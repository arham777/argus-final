1. Formulating the three laws of motion, which describe the relationship between an object's motion, its mass, and the force acting upon it.

2. Developing the law of universal gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

3. Inventing calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation.

4. Conducting experiments on optics and light, leading to his development of the theory of color and the invention of the reflecting telescope.

5. Making significant contributions to the field of mathematics, including his work on infinite series,</td>

          <td>The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, states that species evolve over time through a process of natural selection. This process occurs when individuals within a population possess certain traits that give them a higher chance of surviving and reproducing in their environment. These advantageous traits are then passed on to future generations, leading to the gradual change and adaptation of species over time. Natural selection is driven by factors such as competition for resources, environmental changes, and genetic variation within populations. This theory is considered one of the most important and well-supported explanations for the diversity of life on Earth.</td>
