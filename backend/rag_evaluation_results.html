She was an English mathematician and writer, known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer.</td>

          <td>What did Isaac Newton contribute to science?</td>
          <td>Isaac Newton made numerous contributions to the field of science, including:

1. Laws of motion: Newton's three laws of motion laid the foundation for classical mechanics and provided a framework for understanding the motion of objects.

2. Law of universal gravitation: Newton proposed that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

3. Calculus: Newton developed the mathematical field of calculus independently of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Calculus has become an essential tool in many areas of science and engineering.

4. Optics: Newton conducted experiments with light and prisms, leading to his discovery that white light is composed of</td>

          <td>What is the theory of evolution by natural selection?</td>
          <td>The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century. It states that individuals within a population vary in their traits, and those traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. Over time, this process of natural selection leads to the gradual change and adaptation of species to their environments. In other words, organisms that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. This theory is the cornerstone of modern evolutionary biology and has been supported by a vast amount of scientific evidence.</td>
          <td>Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution by natural selection in his book 'On the Origin of Species'.</td>
